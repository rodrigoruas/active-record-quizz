# 1. What's a relational database?

# A group/set of tables linked to each other using foreign_keys


# 2. What are the different table relationships you know?

# 1:N -> one to many
# N:N -> many to many relationship


# 3. Consider this e-library service. An author, defined by his
#     name have several books. A book, defined by its title and
#     publishing year, has one author only. Whatâ€™s this simple
#     database scheme. Please draw it!




# 4. A user, defined by his email, can read several books. A
#    book (e-book!!) can be read by several users. We also want
#    to keep track of reading dates. Improve your e-library DB
#     scheme with relevant tables and relationships.




# 5. What's the language we use to make queries to the database?

# SQL


# 6. GO TO SQL FILE




# 7. GO TO SQL FILE




# 8. What's the purpose of ActiveRecord?

# Active Record is a library that make our life easier.
# Design pattern that maps your objects into a relational database
# it replaces SQL queries by simple ruby methods


# 9. What's a migration? How do you run a migration?

# a script modifying the schema of the database
# rake db:migrate

# 10. Complete the migrations

class CreateAuthors < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :authors do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :books do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.integer :published_year
      #t.integer :author_id
      t.references :author, foreign_key: true
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :email
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

class CreateReadings < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :readings do |t|
      t.date :date
      t.references :book, foreign_key: true
      t.references :user, foreign_key: true
    end
  end
end


# 11. Write migration to add category to books

class AddCategoryToBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    #add_column #table_name, #column_name, #column_type
    add_column :books, :category, :string
  end
end

# 12. Define the models for each table in your database

class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :books
  validates :name, uniqueness: true
end

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  has_many :readings
  has_many :users, through: :readings
end

class Reading < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :book
  belongs_to :user
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :readings
  has_many :bookings, through: :readings
end

# 13. Complete following code using relevant ActiveRecord methods

#   1. Add your favourite author to the db
  ken_follet = Author.new(name: "Ken Follet")
  ken_follet.save

#   2. Get all authors
  Author.all

#   3. Get author with the id=8
  Author.find(8)

#   4. Get author with name="Jules Verne", store in a variable: jules

  # returns one author
  jules = Author.find_by(name: "Jules Verne")

  # return a list of authors
  jules = Author.where(name: "Jules Verne").first

#   5. Get Jujes Verne's books

  jules.books

#   6. Create a new book "20000 Leagues under the sea", it's missing
#      in the DB. Store it in a variable: twenty_thousand
  twenty_thousand = Book.new(title: "20000 Leagues under the sea", published_year: 1870)

#   7. Add Jules Verne as this book's author
 twenty_thousand.author = jules

#   8. Now save this book in the DB.
twenty_thousand.save


# 14. Add validations of your choice to the Author class. Can we save
#     an object in the DB if the validations do not pass?

class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :books
  validates :name, uniqueness: true
  validates :name, presence: true

  # validates :name, uniqueness: true, presence: true


end
